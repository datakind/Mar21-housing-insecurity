    "NYC_EvictionRates.ipynb"
This notebook explores eviction rates for 2017, 2018, 2019 in NYC.  The results demonstrate eviction rates were dropping each year with the largest drop starting around September 2018 and continuing with a clear, consistent drop in evictions.  The eviction rate for 2019 dropped 4 times the 2018 rate.

    "NYC_ACS_Eviction_Correlations.ipynb"
This notebook explored tax lein information by Tax Code.  The results demonstrate a higher percentage of tax leins fall under Tax Code 1, however I did not have time to find population percentages for Tax Codes to add meaning.  Started searching for key data to correlate the Lein data with other tables, no luck with the Tract Code, would look for GeoTract code id information if more time to correlate the tables.
